Templates is a win32 application. It will create templates for work documents for you based on information gleaned from case information stored on your machine. See ci-daemon on gathering some of this information automatically. 

## Installation

Download the source and build.bat and build. The executable will be generated in ./build/...exe. Make sure you have the case information python script installed with any of its dependencies as well. 

## Usage

Double click the exe. 


## Contributing
